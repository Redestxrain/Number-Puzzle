## Project Overview
This project is a digital puzzle game developed as the final assignment for an engineering programming course. The game involves arranging a 4x4 grid of numbers (1-15) and a special tile in a specific sequence.

## Game Features
- **Modes**: Two playing modes - Free Mode (no move limits) and Challenge Mode (limited to 100 moves).
- **Character Selection**: Players can choose from six characters, each with unique visual themes.
- **Puzzle Solvability**: The game checks if the randomly generated puzzle is solvable.
- **Scoring**: Tracks the number of moves and time taken to solve the puzzle.

## Technical Details
- **Languages & Libraries**: C++ with standard libraries.
- **Key Functions**: Puzzle solvability checking, number swapping, dynamic color changes in the console, and gameplay logic.
- **Source Code**: See `main.cpp` for detailed implementation.

## Future Enhancements
- Improving the real-time display of remaining time in Speed Mode.
- Introducing unique abilities for each character to add more depth to the game.
